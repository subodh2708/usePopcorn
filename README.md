This project helped me combine multiple intermediate-level React concepts into one practical app:

- Managing state effectively with **useState**
- Handling side effects and data fetching with **useEffect**
- Creating and reusing **custom hooks** (`useMovies`, `useLocalStorageState`, `useKey`)
- Working with async functions and handling API errors
- Component composition, conditional rendering, and prop drilling
- Using the **OMDb API** for real-world data
